# Shareholder Transfer

There may be times when you want to change the share structure of your company; either by adding a new shareholder or by changing the existing proportion of shares between shareholders. A share transfer is the process of transferring existing shares from one person to another; either by sale or gift.
You can create three types of entries her- Issue, Transfer and Purchase. In issue entry new shares are created for the company to be issued to the shareholder, transfer of shares transfers existing shares to shareholders and repurchase cancels out shares of the company. The share series (From no. - To No.) is unique to the shares assigned.

You can directly create your Shareholders via

> Accounts > Share Transfer
